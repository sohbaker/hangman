## Hangman game

We'd like you to build a game of Hangman you can play on the command line

Core features

- User should be greeted by a message - achieved
- User has a fixed number of guesses - achieved
- Shows which letters have been guessed correctly - achieved
- Shows if a user has won or lost - achieved

Stretch Goals

- Show a list of the wrong letters - achieved
- Computer picks a random word - achieved
- User can choose to play again - achieved

Steps:

- Start with a spike (see if you can hack bits of the game together on your own without tests)
- Throw the code away
- Start again with TDD in pairs
- Don't start with the IO (i.e. `puts` `gets`) tests unless you're feeling ambitious!
